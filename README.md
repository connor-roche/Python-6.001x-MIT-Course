# Python 6.001x MIT Course

I completed MIT's Python Introduction online course, via edx, over the summer. I did this in order to interact and learn from MIT's world-class faculty and make sure that my CS foundations are solid for future learning and classes at 
NJIT.

**All problem sets are done exclusively in Python**


Problem Set 1 - Three basic programs dealing with strings.

Problem Set 2 - Implement a program that calculates credit card debt and multiple payments methods. Then use Bisection Search to make the program faster.

Problem Set 3 - Implement an interactive hangman game for the user to play.

Problem Set 4 - Implement an interactive word game where the user is dealt a hand of letters and has to try and use all the letters to make words or a single word to gain points. Then make it so the user can ask the computer to play and the computer will find the largest word that can be made from the given letters.

Problem Set 5 - Implement a program that makes use of a hierarchical class structure and inheritance to encrypt and decrypt text.
