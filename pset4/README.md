Implement an interactive word game where the user is dealt a hand of letters and has to try and use all the letters to make words or a single word to gain points. Then made it so the user can ask the computer to play and the computer will find the largest word that can be made from the given letters.

The game is similar to Scrabble. I used a variety of structures to help organize the creation of the game.
