- Implemented a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month.

- Implemented a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order pay off a credit card balance within 12 months. By a fixed monthly payment, I mean a single number which does not change each month, but instead is a constant amount that will be paid each month. Then Utilized Bisection Search to make the program faster.
